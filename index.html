					<strong>
						Marchmont Playgroup provides pre-school children with a safe and stimulating environment in which
						every child is valued as an individual. Playgroup is about learning, playing, exploring and having fun.
					</strong>
				</p>
				<img src="images/slide.jpg" alt="Sliding at Marchmont Playgroup, Edinburgh" title="Sliding at Marchmont Playgroup, Edinburgh" style="float:right;" />

				<p>
					Playgroup is open on <strong>Tuesday</strong>, <strong>Wednesday</strong> and <strong>Thursday</strong>
					mornings from </strong>9.30am-12pm</strong>. Children who attend playgroup are aged from
					<strong>2&frac14;</strong> to <strong>4</strong> years old. When running at full capacity there are
					<strong>24 children</strong>, with a child:adult ratio of <strong>5:1</strong>.
				</p>


				<h3>Parent's Role</h3>
				<p>
					The role of parents and carers is crucial in the running of the Playgroup and this partnership
					is seen as one of its greatest strengths. Each parent or carer is asked to carry out regular duty
					days at the playgroup - usually two or three days per half term. Parents also take responsibility
					for the management of the group by joining the Playgroup Committee. Committee Roles are very varied,
					and ALL parents/carers are needed to join in and share tasks.
				</p>


				<h3>Playgroup Day</h3>
				<p>
					The structure of the playgroup is designed to provide the children with a secure environment in which
					they can play and learn with increased confidence.
				</p>

				<p>
					The playgroup devotes a large part of the morning to free play. Children can choose from a variety of
					activities such as large construction toys, threading activities, art, sand and water play, role play,
					craft, dressing up or listening to a story on the listening station.
				</p>

				<p>
					We encourage outdoor play in one of our gardens, whatever the weather!  Here children can climb on the
					climbing frame, ride the bikes and scooters, play in the playhouse or just run about. The gates to both
					gardens are securely locked and supervised at all times.
				</p>

				<p>
					Activities are often theme based and centre on seasonal or cultural factors. In autumn, for example, we
					might look at leaves and print with them. In winter we will explore ice and create our own snowflakes.
					In summer we explore growing things and use some of the space outside to do this.
				</p>

				<p>
					The children come together for snack time in the middle of the session. They are given a drink of milk
					or water and a healthy snack. They are encouraged to help by handing out plates, passing snacks to each
					other and clearing away.
				</p>

				<p>
					Towards the end of the morning the children enjoy a singing and story time session. This is also the
					time when the children show their friends their 'treasures' (something they have brought from home).
				</p>

				<p>
					You can find out more about our curriculum by talking to a member of staff.
				</p>
